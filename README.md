# A Chrome extension to use GitHub without distracting features

Package available in [releases tab](https://github.com/githubpluslove/no-pressure/releases).
Download the most recent version of `github-no-pressure.crx` and open it with Chrome/Chromium.

This extension hides two distracting GitHub features:
- The followers feed on your home page. I don't like how it catch my attention and make me obsessive about other people behavior.
- The contributions calendar and streak counters on user profile page. By far the most distracting stuff on github.
